# Preface

These diagrams, which, in my more recent work, I. have been calling
patterns, are the key to the process of creating form.

The idea of a diagram, or pattern, is very simple. It is an abstract pattern
of physical relationships which resolves a small system of interacting
and conflicting forces, and is independent of all other forces, and of all
other possible diagrams. The idea that it is possible to create such abstract
relationships one at a time, and to create designs which are whole
by fusing these relationships-this amazingly simple idea is, for me, the
most important discovery of the book. 

I am very sorry that this has happened, and want to state, publicly, that I
reject the whole idea of design methods as a subject of study, since I
think it is absurd to separate the study of designing from the practice of
design. In fact, people who study design methods without also practicing
design are almost always frustrated designers who have no sap in them,
who have lost, or never had, the urge to shape things. Such a person will
never be able to say anything sensible about "how" to shape things
either.

Poincare once said: "Sociologists discuss sociological methods; physicists
discuss physics." I love this statement.

In the process of trying to create such diagrams or patterns for yourself, you will reach the central idea which this book is all about.
