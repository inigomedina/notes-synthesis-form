# Introduction. The need for rationality.

These notes are abouf the process of design; the process of
inventing physical things which display new physical order,
organization, form, in response to function.

Today functional problems are becoming less simple all the
time. But designers rarely confess their inability to solve them.

Today more and more design problems are reaching insoluble
levels of complexity.

To match the growing complexity of problems, there is a growing body of information and specialist experience. This information is hard to handle; it is widespread, diffuse, unorganized. The technical difficulties of grasping all the information needed for the construction of such a form are out of hand - and well beyond the fingers of a single individual.

At the same time that the problems increase in quantity,
complexity, and difficulty, they also change faster than before.

The use of logical structures to represent design problems
has an important consequence. It brings with it the loss of
innocence. 

A logical picture is easier to criticize than a vague
picture since the assumptions it is based on are brought out
into the open. Its increased precision gives us the chance to
sharpen our conception of what the design process involves.

There has already been one loss of innocence in the recent
history of design ; the discovery of machine tools to replace
hand craftsmen.

Enormous resistance to the idea of systematic processes
of design is coming from people who recognize correctly the
importance of intuition, but then make a fetish of it which
excludes the possibility of asking reasonable questions.

We must face the fact that we are on the brink of times
when man may be able to magnify his intellectual and inventive
capability, just as in the nineteenth century he used machines
to magnify his physical capacity.19 Again, as then, our
innocence is lost. And again, of course, the innocence, once
lost, cannot be regained. The loss demands attention, not
denial.
