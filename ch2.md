# Goodness of fit

The ultimate object of design is form.

D' Arcy Thompson has even called form the "diagram of forces" for the irregularities. More usually we speak of these irregularities as the 
functional origins of the form. 

The following argument is based on the assumption that
physical clarity cannot be achieved in a form until there is
first some programmatic clarity in the designer's mind and
actions; and that for this to be possible, in turn, the designer
must first trace his design problem to its earliest functional
origins and be able to find some sort of pattern in them.3 I
shall try to outline a general way of stating design problems
which draws attention to these functional origins, and makes
their pattern reasonably easy to see.

It is based on the idea that every design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context.

**The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem.**

Good fit is a desired property of this ensemble which relates to some particular division of the ensemble into form and context.

There is a wide variety of ensembles which we can talk about like this.

1. Biological ensemble made up of a natural organism and its physical environment is the most familiar: in this case we are used to describe the fit between the two as well-adaptedness.

2. The ensemble consisting of a suit and tie is a familiar case in point.

3. The ensemble may be a game of chess, where at a certain stage of the game some moves are more appropriate than others because they fit the context of the previous moves more aptly.

4. The ensemble may be a musical composition.

The rightness of the form depends, in each one of these cases, on the degree to which it fits the rest of the ensemble.

There are two sides to this tendency designers have to
change the definition of the problem. On the one hand, the
impractical idealism of designers who want to redesign entire
cities and whole processes of manufacture when they are asked
to design simple objects is often only an attempt to loosen
difficult constraints by stretching the form-context boundary.

On the other hand, this way in which the good designer
keeps an eye on the possible changes at every point of the ensemble is part of his job. He is bound, if he knows what he
is doing, to be sensitive to the fit at several boundaries within
the ensemble at once. Indeed, this ability to deal with several
layers of form-context boundaries in concert is an important
part of what we often refer to as the designer's sense of organization.

Understanding the field of the context and inventing a form
to fit it are really two aspects of the same process.

If we go back to the procedure of leveling metal faces against
a standard block, and think about the way in which good fit
and bad fit present themselves to us, we find a rather curious
feature . Oddly enough, the procedure suggests no direct practical
way of identifying good fit. We recognize bad fit whenever
we see a high spot marked by ink. But in practice we see
good fit only from a negative point of view, as the limiting
case where there are no high spots. 

Their wrongness is somehow more immediate than the rightness of less peculiar behavior, and therefore more compelling. 

When we speak of bad fit we refer to a single identifiable
property of an ensemble, which is immediate in experience,
and describable.

With this in mind, I should like to recommend that we
should always expect to see the process of achieving good fit
between two entities as a negative process of neutralizing the
incongruities, or irritants, or forces, which cause misfit.
